Sample data to experiment with at maptimeSTL meetups!

There is absolutely no guarantee this data is current/complete/correct - we've just grabbed some interesting datasets from around the internet.

You can use these data files to make your own web maps using the tools of your choice!  Here are some beginner-friendly tools to try out:

###CartoDB

You can import any of these datasets into CartoDB by pointing CartoDB toward the "raw" url of the data (ask if you need help!)
Here's a tutorial to help you make your first map: [http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/simple_points_map.html](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/simple_points_map.html)

###Mapbox

###Leaflet
You'll need a text editor for this one, because you'll be writing your own html and javascript (don't worry - there's a lot you can copy/paste).
